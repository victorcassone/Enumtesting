/*Why not just used a interface and a super class instead of a abstract class?
There are situations where you would want to have the abstract methods and the already
known methods together

When would I need a abstract class? Real life example?

Abstract class.. some similar functions some that need to be defined for a specific situation
	
	
Why not just use a normal super class and override each method instead of writing abstract classes
You could but it would be very inefficent and opens up a lot of room for error if furture coders forget to override it
